# Goals & Requirements



## Operational Purpose

- [ ] **Enhancing Safety:** SANCTUS aims to enhance the safety of humanitarian personnel and assets operating in conflict zones by providing real-time position and identity information to proximal combat units. This helps reduce the risk of accidental targeting and minimizes casualties among humanitarian workers.
- [ ] **Improving Coordination:** SANCTUS facilitates better monitoring of humanitarian efforts, leading to more efficient deployment of resources and response efforts. By providing accurate and up-to-date information, SANCTUS enables improved coordination among humanitarian organizations, military forces, and other stakeholders involved in crisis response and disaster relief.
- [ ] **Faster Response Times:** SANCTUS doubles as a distress beacon, enabling quicker assistance to individuals or organizations in distress. This feature is especially pertinent due to the threats of kidnapping, ransom, and terrorism faced by many humanitarian agencies. By enabling faster response times, SANCTUS helps save lives and mitigate the impact of emergencies.
- [ ] **Enhanced Civil-Military Cooperation:** SANCTUS fosters collaboration between military and humanitarian actors, facilitating joint efforts in crisis response and disaster relief. By improving communication and coordination between these groups, SANCTUS contributes to greater trust, efficiency, and effectiveness in humanitarian operations.
- [ ] **Legal Compliance:** SANCTUS helps military organizations comply with international humanitarian law and rules of engagement, minimizing the risk of legal, ethical, and moral violations. By providing clear and verifiable information about the identity and location of humanitarian personnel and assets, SANCTUS helps prevent accidental attacks and ensures compliance with legal standards.
- [ ] **Increased Transparency and Oversight:** SANCTUS promotes transparency in humanitarian and military operations by providing real-time location and identity data that can be monitored to enforce compliance with legal and ethical standards. By enhancing transparency and oversight, SANCTUS contributes to greater accountability and responsibility in crisis situations 
- [ ] **Data for Analysis:** Researchers and analysts can use SANCTUS data to study patterns of conflict, humanitarian assistance, human rights violations, and contribute to evidence-based policymaking and advocacy. By providing valuable data for analysis, SANCTUS supports efforts to understand and address the root causes of humanitarian violence and conflict.

## Developmental Goals

- [ ] **Technology Development:** Develop robust and reliable radio beacon technology capable of broadcasting SPIRITUS beacons efficiently and securely.
- [ ] **Protocol Development:** Establish standardized protocols for encoding and decoding SPIRITUS beacons, ensuring compatibility and interoperability across different devices and systems.
- [ ] **Security Enhancement:** Implement strong encryption mechanisms, such as PGP encryption, to ensure the security and integrity of SANCTUS transmissions and prevent unauthorized access or tampering.
- [ ] **Prototype Testing:** Build and test prototype SANCTUS devices and systems in simulated and real-world environments to assess their performance, reliability, and effectiveness.
- [ ] **User Interface Design:** Design user-friendly interfaces for SANCTUS devices and software applications, making them intuitive and easy to use for both humanitarian and military personnel.
- [ ] **Scalability:** Develop SANCTUS technology and infrastructure to be scalable, capable of supporting large-scale deployment across multiple regions and conflict zones.
- [ ] **Interoperability:** Ensure interoperability with existing communication and tracking systems used by military forces, humanitarian organizations, and other stakeholders involved in crisis response and disaster relief.
- [ ] **Resilience:** Design SANCTUS systems to be resilient to various environmental factors and operational conditions commonly encountered in conflict zones, such as interference, jamming, and adverse weather.
- [ ] **Regulatory Compliance:** Ensure compliance with relevant international regulations and standards governing the use of radio frequency technology, encryption, and data privacy in humanitarian and military contexts.
- [ ] **Continuous Improvement:** Establish mechanisms for ongoing monitoring, evaluation, and feedback to identify areas for improvement and refinement of SANCTUS technology and protocols over time.
